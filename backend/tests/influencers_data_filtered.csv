N/A,N/A,0,"💵 Do you explicitly identify what you want in a demand letter? 

I have seen plenty of demand letters that clearly seek ... something ... but make no firm ask. 

I assume most of the senders are worried about locking themselves into a lowball offer or wary about violating the unwritten ""rule"" not to make the first move. 

But consider the alternative. 

What if everything goes spectacularly your way? 

The letter's recipient is more than open-minded, flush with cash and good vibes and great intention, and maybe an attorney advising them to settle at any cost. 

What then? 

Are they supposed to divine what you want, make it rain, and call it a day? 

Not going to happen. 

Try this next time: if you are uncomfortable proposing a specific result, at least define what you are after:

➡️ ""We want this matter to be resolved before litigation or publicity."" 
➡️ ""The Smith family must retain a majority of the holding company's and operating company's shares."" 
➡️ ""Any potential settlement must cover, at minimum, the amount needed to replace the giant fleet of cars your shipping agent let float into the Pacific.""

It's normal to hold your cards close to the vest. But if you don't explicitly outline for your counterpart what you REALLY want, you risk a hollow victory if the other side is ready to play ball.

Be clear. Be concise. Give them a target to hit - even if it is ambitious or unrealistic. 

And if you can sprinkle in some humor, like Netflix did with the Logan Square Emporium location years ago, all the better.

It’s not 25, 30, or even 35.

In 1962, Sam Walton started Walmart at age 44. By 1970, Walmart had 37 stores and IPO’d.

By 1992, when Walton stepped down as CEO, Walmart had 1,735 stores and $50B in revenue.

Even in tech:
- Reed Hastings founded Netflix at 36
- Jeff Bezos founded Amazon at 30
- Travis Kalanick founded Uber at 32
- Marc Benioff founded Salesforce at 35
- Reid Hoffman founded LinkedIn at 36
- Dave Duffield founded Workday at 65 (who started up again at 76!)

Social media makes it seem like the only people who can succeed in startups are 20 year-old college dropouts.

But here’s the reality:
- The median age of unicorn founders is 34
- The median age of the top 1% of unicorn founders is 45

Why?

With age comes irreplaceable experience: knowing the best problems to solve, the optimal ways to execute, which people to hire, and what truly matters in your business. 

Walton owned 15 franchise stores of a chain called Ben Franklin before starting Walmart. Without learning the power of high-volume, low-margin sales at Ben Franklin, Walton would never have started Walmart.

Today, Walmart has the highest revenue in the world ($680B+).

So if you’re thinking about starting up, don’t ask:
“Am I too old?”

Instead ask:
“Am I ready to build something that lasts?”",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/albert-mao_the-perfect-age-to-start-a-startup-isnt-activity-7329128517592301568-WUzw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADkZGWkB04tJGESNDVHaPixureBEadG9mts,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,0,0,0,0

A relentless focus on execution instead of planning.

David Sacks, COO of PayPal, said after joining: “I had to unlearn everything I learned at McKinsey.”

Why?

At PayPal, Sacks noticed that everyone discussed but never actually acted upon action items from long planning sessions.

So he devised a system called: “The List.”

“The List” was a simple list prioritizing issues and action items. Every morning, Sacks assigned items to team members. No formal procedures, just “do it.”

One morning, a marketing manager wanted to discuss “strategy” for a branding campaign. Sacks replied: “Fix the fraud first,” and handed him a task from The List.

Something as simple as “The List” drastically improved Paypal’s speed and output.

Business schools teach you about management frameworks. But the truth is: not only do they not help; they slow things down.

Didn’t learn management frameworks? That’s ok. The best people are too busy executing.

Many people think that if a founder raises millions, it makes them a millionaire.

But here’s the reality of being a founder:
- I share a 1 bedroom apartment with my co-founder to cut costs
- I keep an air mattress in the office to sleep on when I work past 2AM
- I eat microwave meals because they're fast and cheap
- I canceled my gym membership and bike to work for exercise

,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"A year ago, a founder raised $20M at a $200M+ valuation from top VCs. Last month, the company ran out of cash and was forced to shut down. 

Startups often fail, but this founder:
- Took out millions of secondary (cash for themselves) 
- Spent the last year traveling the world 
- Angel invested in 20+ startups
- Served on 3 nonprofit boards
- Became a startup mentor for multiple top accelerators
- Hid revenue metrics from their employees
- Left their company (50+ employees) 2 months before the company shut down

Now the employees are left with nothing and are scrambling to find employment. 

The good news? You can avoid joining these startups before it’s too late.

Many people worry about performing well in job interviews.

But the reality is, you should be interviewing the founder as much as the founder is interviewing you.

Top 5 questions to ask the founder:
✅ What are the top 3 reasons your company might fail?
✅ What motivated you to start the company?
✅ What are the biggest disagreements between you and your cofounder?
✅ What are your plans after founding?
✅ Why did previous employees leave the company?

Most people who join the wrong startup are baited by flashy headlines.

But if you join the right startup, you’ll grow in ways you never imagined.

,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"Last month, I watched a startup’s entire 10-person engineering team quit on the same day. They had already raised $15M. Why? 

Since founding, their CEO had spent 2 years speaking about ""AI Ethics"" at conferences, touting their “revolutionary” product.

Under the hood, they didn’t have any users. 

The final straw was when the CEO:
- Refused to review the product
- Called their senior engineers ""replaceable"" 
- Cut the engineering budget to fund more conference appearances
- Spent $100k on a Miami offsite

While these startups look shiny on the surface, 100% of them have failed. 

🚩 4 of the most dangerous startup red flags. Founders:
- Treat being a ""founder"" as their personality
- Spend a lot of $ on things that do not improve the product
- Overuse words like “revolutionary” and “helping humanity” 
- Appear often at speaking engagements

Here's the truth no one talks about:

Building the wrong product isn't failure. Neither is running out of money.

True failure is ego destroying your team's trust. No amount of funding or tech can fix that.

The good news? Founders who act like this make it easy to spot the good ones.

Your talent deserves a team that builds together, not a founder who’s only in it for themselves.

,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"3 months ago, two of my childhood best friends celebrated raising $5M for their seed round. Today, they aren’t even on speaking terms.

I’ve seen this on repeat for the last 2 years. 

Behind every failed startup, there are:
- 2am fights on Slack about equity
- CTO pushing code at midnight. CEO attending investor dinners for months
- One co-founder saying: “I’m too busy to go to standup”

Not the clean “we decided to part ways” BS you hear.

In my YC batch, co-founder breakups were the #1 reason why startups failed. At least 1 out of 2 startups that failed was due to this.

🚩Top 3 red flags I’ve seen:

- Resentment: You don’t think the other person is pulling their weight 
- Lack of alignment: Misaligned risk tolerance, target market, product decisions, etc
- Conflict resolution: Can’t have hard conversations because you don’t want to hurt each other’s feelings

In the early stage, there’s a lot of ambiguity. There will be failure. It will test any relationship, however strong you think it is. 

However, your relationships (not just for founders) are in your control! If you don’t address it, it will sneak up on you. Spend time having the hard conversations and you can significantly increase the chances of success.

He went on to say: 
- Getting into YC is a “rite of passage”
- People often do multiple startup accelerators / programs / competitions one after the other
- The most common idea is “Social media platform to help you make friends”

Pre-med >> Venture Capital >> Investment Banking >> Private Equity >> Hedge Fund >> Consulting >> Business Operations >> Product Management >> Startup Founder

Each of the previous experience has helped me become a startup founder:
- Premed: How to work hard

- Investment Banking: How to build slide decks and financial models 
- Private Equity / Hedge Funds: How to analyze companies
- Consulting: How to influence clients
- Business Operations: How to execute large projects from point A to point B
- Product Management: How to build something users love

No one cared.

People often think that raising money and getting into a prestigious accelerator are the hallmarks of success as a founder.

It is far from it.

There are millions of tactical steps in between. This past year:
I did sales
I did customer support
I did marketing
I did interviewing
I did product QA
I did client deployments
I did legal and compliance
I did bookkeeping
And more

Many people think being a founder is about raising money, setting the high-level strategy, and giving the team instructions from an ivory tower.

The reality is doing whatever it takes for the customer to have a better experience and to solve their pain points.

10+ launches later (and many more failed ones), we now have thousands of paying customers and tens of thousands of users.

There are still millions of more steps left, but we are excited to continue on this journey with our customers.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/albert-mao_last-year-we-got-into-yc-and-raised-3m-activity-7265001442283851776-MH_7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADkZGWkB04tJGESNDVHaPixureBEadG9mts,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,0,0,0,0
,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"Hailey Bieber just sold rhode for $1B.

In 2022, she launched rhode with three skincare essentials: Peptide Glazing Fluid, Barrier Restore Cream, and Peptide Lip Treatment.

Each one designed like part of a perfect outfit—what Hailey called the “leather jacket, jeans, and tee” of your skincare routine.

No big-box retailers. No army of paid promos. No 40-shade foundation drop. Just her own face, routine, and vision.

Just clean formulas, under-$30 price points, and one clear promise: hydrated, dewy, glazed-doughnut skin.

It sold out in 10 minutes.

The Glazing Fluid alone had a 100,000+ person waitlist.

And at one point, 36 units were selling every second.

Hailey knew exactly what she was doing.

Here’s what founders can learn from her playbook...

👉 Start small—but surgical
Three products. One aesthetic. Every texture, ingredient, and price point was obsessively tested by Hailey herself. 

👉 Let your community do the marketing
No traditional ads. Just real people, real GRWMs, and a TikTok frenzy. From glazed nails to dewy skin, rhode didn’t just sell product—it became a reference point in pop culture.

👉 Own the narrative
Hailey wasn’t a face on a bottle. She was the founder, creative director, and product developer—deeply involved from packaging to final formula. That authenticity built real trust.

👉 Collaborate with culture
The rhode x Erewhon Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie wasn’t just a drink. It was $20 of wellness marketing genius—collagen, sea moss, and LA health culture blended into a viral moment.

👉 Stay direct
Rhode launched DTC—controlling every touchpoint with its customers. Only after proving demand did it expand to Sephora in the U.S. and U.K.

👉 Make it a feeling, not just a product
Hailey wasn’t chasing trends. She is the glazed skin aesthetic. Her goal? Not just glowing skin—but serotonin in a serum. “I want people to feel like they’re part of a world,” she said. And she built one.

👉 Exit on your terms
 By 2025, rhode hit $212M in sales, ranked #1 in earned media value, and was just acquired by e.l.f. for $1B. Hailey will stay on as Chief Creative Officer and Head of Innovation—doubling down, not cashing out.

And just like that, rhode became one of the biggest beauty deals of the decade.

,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"Her daughter died. Her pastor abused her. And out of that wreckage—Auntie Anne's was born.

In 1975, Anne Beiler’s 19-month-old daughter was killed in a freak farming accident.

Anne wasn’t just heartbroken. 

She was drowning.

She sought comfort from her pastor—who used her grief to sexually abuse her for six years.

She couldn’t speak. Couldn’t sleep. Could barely survive.

Her marriage to Jonas—her teenage sweetheart—nearly collapsed under the weight of unspoken pain.

Until one morning, Anne confessed. 

And together, they began again.

Jonas felt called to offer free counseling to others in crisis. 

But they had no money. 

So Anne borrowed $6,000 from her father-in-law and bought a broken-down pretzel stand at a Pennsylvania farmers market.

The pretzels? Terrible. 

The odds? Worse. 

She had no education past 8th grade. No business experience. Just purpose.

And then—something clicked. 

A tweak to the recipe, a spark of faith, and suddenly… the line was out the door.

By the end of year one: $100,000 in sales.

By year two: franchising.

By 2005: 1,200 stores in 26 countries.

Anne built the world’s biggest soft pretzel empire. 

She started sharing her story. 

And today, she is no longer “just” the woman behind Auntie Anne’s.

She’s a speaker. A survivor. A guide for women learning to turn pain into purpose.

,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"This woman sold her book club for $900M.

In the mid-2010s, Reese Witherspoon’s acting career hit a wall. 

After winning an Oscar in 2006, she spent nearly a decade in rom-com limbo.

Studios weren’t giving her great roles—and the ones she did take flopped. 

So she started reading.

Not just a personal habit. 

But as market research.

In 2017, she launched Reese’s Book Club with one rule: every pick had to be a story where a woman drives the narrative. 

She shared the books with her fans and used her monthly selections to test which stories resonated most with real audiences.

Then she built the next layer of the model.

She founded Hello Sunshine (her media company) and started making deals directly with authors.

The pitch was simple: I’ll give you access to my audience—you’ll sell a ton of books. In return, I just want the future rights to adapt your story.

In some cases, she paid upfront to option the IP. 

In others, she secured a right of first refusal—meaning if anyone else wanted to buy the screen rights, she’d get the first shot.

If the book performed well with her audience, she’d move fast: develop it for TV or film, pitch it to a streamer, and either produce it—or star in it herself.

This is how projects like Big Little Lies, Little Fires Everywhere, The Morning Show, and Daisy Jones and the Six got made. 

All four were based on books. 

All four were developed by Hello Sunshine. 

And all four had massive built-in audiences before they hit screens.

Traditionally, studios take huge bets on expensive scripts and hope audiences will care. 

Witherspoon flipped that model. 

She let the audience choose first—then built the content around their response.

It worked. 

In 2021, she sold Hello Sunshine to Candle Media in a deal that valued the company at $900M. 

She took home an estimated $120M personally and retained an ownership stake. 

At the same time, she became one of the highest-paid women in TV, earning $1M+ per episode for The Morning Show.

She only pursued stories that already had traction. 

She only developed content once there was data. 

She didn’t raise huge outside capital. 

And she partnered with streamers who were hungry for proven IP and willing to fund production.

That iconic line from Legally Blonde:
“You got into Harvard Law?”
“What, like it’s hard?”

Reese Witherspoon gave it a sequel: 
“You built a billion-dollar media company without writing or publishing a single book?”
“No big deal. I just bought the rights.”

,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"She could’ve been a billionaire. Instead, she poured her millions into funding books, scholarships, hospital wings, and rebuilding entire towns.

Dolly Parton was born in a one-room cabin in the Smoky Mountains. 

Her father paid the doctor with a sack of cornmeal. 

They were dirt poor. 

She never forgot it.

By the time she was ten, she was performing on radio. 

At eighteen, she moved to Nashville the day after high school graduation. 

She wrote more than 3,000 songs, sold over 100 million records, and turned down Elvis Presley when he asked for half the rights to “I Will Always Love You.” 

That one decision made her millions. 

She reinvested them—into herself, her business, and her people.

She opened Dollywood in 1986, now one of the most visited theme parks in America. 

She co-owns restaurants, resorts, water parks, and a production company. 

Her net worth is estimated at over $650M.

But her biggest legacy isn’t her music. 

It’s her giving.

In 1995, she created Imagination Library in honor of her father, who couldn’t read or write. 

Since then, the program has mailed over 270 million free books to children across the US, UK, Canada, Ireland, and Australia. 

It now reaches one in ten children under five in the United States.

In 2016, when wildfires destroyed hundreds of homes in her hometown, she created the My People Fund. 

She gave $1,000 a month for six months to over 900 families. 

At the end, she surprised them all with an extra $5,000 check. 

The fund raised over $13M.

In 2020, she quietly donated one million dollars to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 

That money helped develop the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

In 2022, she gave another million to support pediatric infectious disease research. 

That same year, she made college tuition free for every Dollywood employee—seasonal, part-time, or full-time. 

One hundred percent of tuition, books, and fees covered from day one.

She’s raised money for flood victims in Middle Tennessee. 

Donated $2M for hurricane relief in East Tennessee. 

Built women’s health centers. 

Supported childhood cancer research. 

And kept doing the work, long after the cameras left.

She has never stopped. 

She released 44 Top 10 country albums, the most of any artist in history.

She has won 11 Grammy Awards across five decades of music.

And most importantly, she is the rare kind of leader who turned her name into a brand, and then turned that brand into a vehicle for massive, generational good.

Her father had just passed away.

But instead of preserving the empire, she tore it open and rebuilt it.

Ana was no stranger to pressure. 

At 24, she landed on Wall Street, working at JP Morgan in New York. 

By 28, she was back in Spain, expanding Santander across Latin America—making billion-dollar deals in Chile and Brazil before most executives her age had even led a meeting.

In the early 2000s, she took the helm at Banesto, one of Spain’s most respected banks. 

Then came the UK. 

In 2010, Ana became CEO of Santander UK, just as public trust in banking had cratered. 

She rebuilt it from the ground up—modernized services, improved customer relationships, and brought a people-first mindset to a broken system.

But 2014 was the turning point.

She opened the boardroom to international voices.

,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"She got sued for funding Black founders.

Carolyn Rodz started at JPMorgan. 

A rising star on the investment banking floor, closing billion-dollar deals in waste management, medical devices, and retail.

But one day she left it all behind to build her dream: a luxury retail brand called Signatures. 

It landed in Neiman Marcus, Harrods, Bloomingdale’s. 

From the outside, it looked like a success.

Then it crashed.

“I knew very little about starting a company, and my first business failed,” she later admitted. “I was sorting through a lot of financial troubles and difficulties.”

She was broke and drowning in debt. 

But she went back to work, paid it off, and built her next company: Cake, a digital media agency for global brands. 

She built it, scaled it, sold it. 

That sale gave her something she didn’t have before: credibility. 

“The world opened to me,” she said. “And I started to wonder—what if every entrepreneur had the same shot?”

So in 2017, she teamed up with Elizabeth Gore to launch Hello Alice: a digital platform built to support the very founders who are always underestimated—women, people of color, veterans, LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs.

The vision was simple: democratize entrepreneurship.

The results? 
  - 1.5M+ entrepreneurs supported
  - $50M+ in grants distributed
  - 92% of Hello Alice businesses are still running

And then came the lawsuit.

In 2023, a Trump-aligned group sued Hello Alice over a grant for Black-owned businesses. 

Within days, two-thirds of their Series C investors backed out. 

Carolyn and Elizabeth had to lay off 69% of their team. 

It looked like game over.

But Carolyn didn’t blink.

“We made really tough decisions as a company. But nobody gets to dictate our future but us.”

She hired one of the top constitutional lawyers in the country. 

Ten months later, they won. The case was dismissed. 

And instead of moving on quietly, Carolyn made the lawsuit’s defense playbook public—so no other founder would have to fight blind.

“Success in DEI means everyone knows they belong at the table. Everyone knows how to show up.”

,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,N/A,N/A,"Meet the first woman to lead a major US bank.

When Jane Fraser stepped into the CEO role at Citigroup in March 2021, the bank was bloated, fragmented, and falling behind its peers. 

Its global sprawl had become a liability, its tech systems were outdated, and regulators had lost patience. 

Citi wasn’t in crisis—but it was stagnating.

Fraser didn’t come in with slogans. She came in with a blueprint.

In her first three years, she sold 9 of Citi’s 14 consumer banking businesses across Asia, Europe, and Latin America. 

She rolled out a complete corporate restructuring—removing layers of bureaucracy, eliminating silos, and flattening the org chart. 

The result? 20,000 job cuts and $1B in severance costs… not exactly headline-friendly.

But Fraser called it necessary if Citi was going to survive the next decade.

She’s not here for quarterly wins. 

She’s here to clean house.

In January 2025, she and Citi’s CFO announced a $20B stock buyback plan.
 
The market responded: Citi stock rose more than 20% in Q1, outperforming nearly every other major U.S. bank. 

And while profits dipped from $14.8B in 2022 to $9.2B in 2023, Fraser has consistently hit guidance targets and kept investor trust—something few thought possible when she took over.

But what makes Jane Fraser stand out isn’t just the strategy. 

It’s how she leads.

She’s the only big bank CEO who didn’t walk back hybrid work. 

While rivals like JPMorgan doubled down on 5-day mandates, Fraser kept remote flexibility in place—especially for roles that don’t require facetime. 

Her logic is simple: great people want autonomy. 

And working parents, especially women, need it.

Fraser knows that firsthand. 

When she was at McKinsey, she worked part-time while raising two sons. 

Later, she ran Citi’s Latin America business from Miami while rebuilding its private bank from red to black. 

And now she’s running a $1.7T global institution without mimicking the men who did it before her.

She’s not trying to be Jamie Dimon. 

She’s trying to build a modern bank.

And she’s doing it under more scrutiny than any of her peers.

Karen S. Lynch’s story didn’t start in a boardroom. 

It started in Ware, Massachusetts, where she lost her mother at 12 and was raised by her aunt.

After earning her accounting degree at Boston College and becoming a CPA, Karen began her career at Ernst & Young, specializing in insurance.

But numbers weren’t enough.

Her ambition led her to join Cigna and Magellan Health, where she took on the tough jobs. 

Leading teams. Turning around struggling divisions. Building businesses that others had given up on.

Over the next decade, she built a reputation for tackling tough problems. 

That’s how, in 2015, she became the first female president of Aetna.

But her biggest leap was yet to come.

In 2021, Karen was named CEO of CVS Health, leading more than 300,000 employees and shaping healthcare for over 100 million Americans.

She wasn’t interested in keeping the status quo.

Her vision was bold:
- Turn every CVS into a neighborhood health hub
- Slash prescription drug prices with a new cost-plus model
- Use Aetna’s data to catch health problems earlier—and lower healthcare costs across America

At first, it worked.

Shares soared. 

Karen topped Fortune's ""Most Powerful Women"" list three years running.

She joined the President's Export Council. 

She even published her memoir, ""Taking Up Space"", inspiring women to speak up and lead boldly.

But in the world of healthcare—and Wall Street—vision isn’t always enough.

Behind the scenes, cracks were forming.

CVS made a series of expensive acquisitions that drained resources.

Margins collapsed at Aetna’s Medicare division.

Eight senior executives departed in two years.

By late 2024, investors were restless. 

CVS missed earnings targets—and Karen was forced out.

Not because she lacked vision.

But because changing a $350B system doesn’t happen overnight—and sometimes, the system pushes back.

It’s easy to celebrate the perfect success stories.

Harder—but more important—to tell the ones that remind us: leading big, risking big, sometimes means falling hard.

Yet, CVS is still chasing parts of Karen’s original vision. 

Primary care at retail. Value-based health models. Data-driven prevention.

Karen Lynch bet on a future that isn’t here yet.

And she nearly pulled it off.

You’ve seen the CVS sign on every street corner.

But had you ever heard the woman who tried to reinvent healthcare from inside one of America's oldest institutions?

""Here comes another tech bubble""

Given the current AI boom, it's fascinating to look back on this.

Watching the video now, everything feels so early - but even then, people believed they were already too late.

A $15 billion valuation for Facebook felt insane at the time. Today, it’s worth over $1.5 trillion.

A $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube raised eyebrows back then. Yet in 2024, YouTube was the second-largest media company by revenue, generating $54.2 billion - second only to Disney.

History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.

Bill Gates captured this perfectly: ""Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten.""

The same applies to fundamental technological platform shifts: we overestimate the short-term impact, and massively underestimate the long-term potential.

We're seeing that play out with AI right now.

There will be many losers. But among them, some of the most iconic companies of the next era will be born.

In so many ways the internet, social networking, mobile and cloud shifts enabled the current AI platform shift we're experiencing.

And the AI shift will be more impactful than all the above combined.

It will however take some time. We're early and we're now looking at a Manhattan and Apollo project scale infrastructure build out.

Here’s to another tech bubble - and to the next Facebooks and YouTubes.

The rise of AI presents an opportunity for a fundamental shift in how recruiting technology should work. Since our founding, Spott has been automating time-consuming recruitment workflows. Now, we’re taking the next step by bringing together everything recruiting & staffing firms need - from AI agents, to a full ATS & CRM and analytics - into one single AI-Native platform.

This fundraise is a huge milestone for Spott (YC W25) and a continued validation of our founding principle that AI will fundamentally transform how recruiters operate and transact. It allows us to accelerate product development and expand our reach to more teams around the world. This fundraise is also a testament to the innovation and value we have already delivered to our clients. My favourite moments are hearing customers say “This is crazy, it’s like magic. I’ve been waiting for something like this”.

Big shoutout to my co-founders Lander Degrève and Samuel Smeys and our founding engineers Senne and Melanie – what an incredible first 8 months, very excited for what is to come! Let’s keep pushing the bounds on what’s possible. 

And a massive thank you to our early customers such as Stanton Chase: Executive Search & Leadership Consultants and PSG - Technology & Science for being part of our journey.

Spott’s seed round was led by Adeyemi Ajao and Rexhep Dollaku from Base10 Partners, with participation from Y Combinator, Filip Van Innis from Fortino Capital, Porter Braswell from True Equity and incredible angels. Special thanks to Tom Blomfield for mentoring us during the YC Winter 2025 batch in San Francisco.
