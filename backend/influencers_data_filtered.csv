A company gets in touch with you, inquires about your availability, and then - poof. Vanishes. You go to a job interview, you feel OK/good about the process, they tell you they’ll be in touch. And then… crickets.  It’s not only companies. Candidates do that all the time. Answering and then ignoring, scheduling a job interview and not showing up, not returning any calls.  Ghosting usually saves you 1-2 minutes of inconvenience. But it brands you as a douche forever.  No one likes uncertainty. Whatever you are - a candidate, a recruiter or a sourcer - treat people like you want to be treated. Be responsible. Learn to say ‘sorry, but no’. Stop ghosting. #ghosting   #career   #hr   #people

Your connections don’t have to be your personal friends. They can just share some of your interests, work at the same company, or field.  When you reach over 10K friends, you can start worrying about the type of people you accept as connections.

Talent Acquisition Specialist - manages the entire hiring process, from screening to contract.  Talent Marketing Specialist- develops the company's Employer Branding and Recruitment Marketing strategies. In charge of evolving recruitment, so the company can attract top talent. HRBP - Responsible for you from the moment your onboarding process ends. HR analytics - collects and analyzes HR data, and applies it to make recommendations related to recruitment, retention, and legal compliance.

Focus on 2 elements in your CV: Title - make sure your title fits the job description. If the job description lists ‘software engineer’, don’t use ‘Backend engineer’ in your CV. If there’s a way to get a perfect match, use it. Keywords - read the full job description. Find what matters in that job. And put as many keywords as possible in your CV.  Pro tip - So many companies are using bots to screen CV. So use the EXACT same words. Use spaces before and after. Don’t let the bots rule you out.  Whatever you do, DO NOT LIE. Especially in the skill section, you will be easily spotted during the interview phase. Once you get caught lying, there’s no turning back.  Does it take time to match your CV with different positions? Yes, it does.  Getting hired is a full-time job.  #people   #hr   #skills

The most popular one is “spray and pray” - sending your CVs to any position, regardless of how relevant it is for you. It can’t hurt, right? Wrong❌ Applying for every single job out there shows Recruiters that you lack focus, passion, and talent. Not very good qualities. Worse than that - sometimes you’ll get in the system, in which case you’ll be marked as someone who was rejected multiple times. So what should you do? 📌Research the company you want to work for. 📌Research the people who work there. 📌Find a RELEVANT job description, one that 📌you have a real shot at.  📌Research that position and try to talk to people in that company who know what it means 📌Adapt your CV to better reflect that position Then - apply✅ *This isn’t 2005 anymore* Invest time and effort, and the chances of finding your dream job will dramatically increase. #hr   #people   #linkedin

These mistakes cost a lot. #Don 't- Upload a LinkedIn post that says you've been looking for a job in the past 6 months and that everyone rejects you/ treats you unfairly in the hiring process.  #Why ? You are your own brand! If you are a brand you should emphasize your professional skills by sharing interesting content and showing interesting projects. You can get empathy from friends but LinkedIn isn't the place for that. #What  should you do instead? Ask a friend to upload a post about you as a reference or focus on side projects and show them on LinkedIn. #Don 't- Use the ""Open to work"" LinkedIn frame  #Why - Although it seems like a cool feature, I know recruiters who say they decline to connect requests from people with the frame in order to prevent inconvenience because they do not have jobs to offer. #What  should you do instead? Open the ""let recruiters know you are open to new opportunity button"", it's discreet and won't show up to recruiters at your company. And yes, marketing-wise it looks much better. All of this info is based on my thoughts research and experience. Feel free to share your opinion. Good luck!  #Jobs   #HR

Both posts were uploaded at the same hour, same picture and subject (You can check the numbers) and yet one of them gained much more exposure (post A).  My explanation is: • Post A is much more personal, I shared my personal goals, feelings and this is what people are looking to read. Tip- don't be afraid to share your feelings and thoughts, you will get much more exposure. • Post A tells a story, compared to post B which is super short and generic. Tip- tell a story and be a storyteller of your career, try to start with a problem and finish with how you solved it. • Post A ends with calling to action, a question. Tip- when you finish with a call to action people will get involved and comment-Boom- more exposure. What do you think? Do you want me to share more of my secrets?:)  #linkedin   #tips

I have exciting data about the industry, 3-months post corona. I will give my insights. The basis for the information is from  AdviceMe.Il   so of course, you can not generalize it to all populations. Nevertheless it's interesting. First - the average age of people who asked for our advice: 26-33. I can explain it mostly by experience, 26-33 usually are employees at the beginning of their careers, and companies prefer to keep the seniors because they're more expensive to hire and of course, more valuable. Second, 1 out of 5 people is a software developer! Well, I was amazed by this one. I would think that SW people who are in high demand would be the last to get fired. I can explain it with 2 ideas - first, most of them are juniors /from small startups that had to close, second, AdviceMe's branding was especially oriented for tech people. Another interesting piece of data- 80% of the people who asked for our advice had at least an undergrad degree. The higher education was the fewer people there were. I guess companies won't let go so fast of people with high education. Also, 90% of people with 3rd degree had a managerial experience which is not a surprise. I want to thank  Or Hazbani   for all his help and great insights. And, 3 months later, I'm back in the office!

Worry less about ""Zoom etiquette"" and more about how your peers, co-workers and fellow humans are doing. Better yet, ask them. It will brighten their day, and yours. Instead of worrying about etiquette: embrace empathy, kindness and forgiveness for Zoom. If you don't feel like the world is ready to see you, for whatever reason, turn the camera off. If you have pets and kids in the background, we love to see them!! If there's noise, it's OK, we'll mute you and laugh about it :).  For the record, I impress these exact same things to the folks in my organization. So please. Let's be kind and patient with each other during these unprecedented times. We're all trying, and not everyone is doing well. The last thing we need to do is hold people accountable for being 2 minutes late to a Zoom meeting, or some other silly thing. Give them a smile and some warm words instead. #dobetter   #empathy   #kindness   #humanity   #leadership

This wasn't the first time I had been disrespected in the workplace, but something about that day was different, because as soon as this person started yelling, I looked at them and said: ""Please lower your voice"". Stunned, they stopped for a second, then continued to yell for another several minutes. After they were out of breath, they waited for me to talk. When I said nothing, they asked what I had to say. My response was simply this: ""I stopped paying attention when you started to raise your voice. The next conversation we'll have will be with HR in the room."" And then I left.  They didn't get fired, but they never yelled again. Not at me, anyway.

While there are many things that make up a great leader, I found the exercise of ranking the top three thought-provoking - this is my list: 1) Practice humanity-first leadership. You can, and should, exceed at both delivery and empathy. They are never mutually exclusive, and equally important. 2) Earn trust through transparency. Don't lie to your employees. EVER. You will eventually be exposed. Be respectfully transparent to the highest extent possible. The trust broken when a leader is caught or exposed for having lied, especially in a public forum, is never ever regained. 3) Actively invest in people's careers. Know the difference between feedback and growth coaching, and how both are applied. Use feedback as teaching moments, not punitively, unless absolutely necessary. Coach your folks on how to grow and succeed, actively and passionately. Advocate for their success proactively, in terms of compensation and promotability. Show them you truly care when it matters most. [EDIT] I’ll add one more: 4) Provide recognition and gratitude. Sincere and genuine “thank you’s” are both free, as well as priceless. Those are my top 3 - what are yours?  #leadership   #dobetter

The litmus test for abandoning ship is very simple:  1) The smartest and most senior people are leaving  2) The work and mission become about “how do we survive” instead of “how do we grow” 3) Hiring stops and backfills/attrition are not honored 4) Management becomes adversarial, starts breaking promises, changes messaging and stops being transparent. 5) Budgets get slashed Any one of these issues in and of itself is cause for concern. Two or more are clear guidance towards the exit sign. Last, and perhaps most important:  Stop romanticizing the workplace in a situation like this. Capitalism and business are a clinical game, not a fairy tale. The only things you get by holding on to hollow words and platitudes instead of evaluating hard data and listening to your gut and instincts are career setbacks, money lost, emotional damage and a bag full of empty promises.  #commonsense   #wisdom   #lifelesson

The culture and dynamics of people leadership have completely changed. It's now an equal partnership of supporting common goals and bringing people along. It's about showing people that they are not disposable objects, and that you genuinely care about them as human beings. It's about being transparent, genuine and kind.  And most importantly, earning trust. Earning trust by not breaking your promises. By not being abrasive, crass, callous, vulgar, violent and rude. By not misleading or lying to your people, hiding things from them, or operating with alternate objectives and hidden agendas in mind. As more and more ""new-school"" leaders and companies emerge, the ""old guard"" of management drifts further into isolation and irrelevance. Learn to lead from a place of honesty, transparency, and kindness. From first principles. Or you'll find yourself ""leading"" shrinking teams, diminishing companies and eventually being replaced by someone who gets what leadership really means.  #leadership   #culture   #management   #dayone

People have choices, and employment at will cuts both ways. They will stay when their work is interesting, the pay is competitive, their work environment is healthy, and their manager is kind, understanding and knows how to grow their careers.

It's incredibly unprofessional.If you email me at work (and I get these daily), you are guaranteed to be blocked and added to Junk Mail. 2) Take the time to read candidate profiles to see where their interests lie, where they are in their careers, and how your role would help them get ahead. Emailing blindly for stuff that clearly doesn't fit just turns candidates off.   3) Don't force a fit. Ever. For any reason. Don't lie. Be as transparent as possible about the opportunity. You're talking to a highly educated populous with access to data and inside company networks that you don't have. We're not dumb and we do our own research. Start with this. Adhere to integrity and first principles. Candidates actually like hearing from you about opportunities they may not otherwise have.

During this time no business meetings are scheduled and employees are encouraged to break away from their work routines and spend time with their families, have lunch, go for a walk, etc. With many kids still away from their physical classrooms, this past month we introduced Kids Connect as an extension to the AFK program.   Today I had the chance to read a book to children in the 8 - 12 age group.  Tough audience and my nerves were shot. I chose one of my daughter Erin’s favorite books - Mr. Stink by David Walliams and I think I may have hit the mark 😌 Absolute joy watching the faces of the kids light up during story time. #innovation   #leadership   #family Ndivhu Nepfumbada   Sarah Steinbach   Anne Leyden

His music was loved the world over but there was one song “Asimbonanga” that will always be the song I will remember him by.  It’s the song he wrote for Nelson Mandela whilst he was on Robben Island in 1987.  I have included a  YouTube  link below so you can watch the time Johnny Clegg got to play his song in 1999 to an international audience only to be surprised by Nelson Mandela walking up on stage to join him in the singing and dancing.  #RIPJohnnyClegg Some background information on Johnny Clegg  https://lnkd.in/dquzemV   https://lnkd.in/dW4QJbN

Whenever we get featured in media or conferences, instead of a personal accolade, I see it as a way to spread a much needed message. The mission at  SoGal Ventures  and  SoGal Foundation  is way bigger than any of us, and I’m dedicating my life’s work to serve the purpose (and finding a lot of joy doing so), so that we can leap forward with long overdue paradigm shifts and create an even better world for the next generation. There is so much untapped potential of women and minorities. Even with a $15M VC fund, 40 city chapters, 65 investments to date, 100,000+ reach of women and diverse entrepreneurs, we are far from scratching the surface. Every day, we are humbled and in awe that we can touch a someone’s life and inspire her to live beyond boundaries.  In my speech I share with people to plan lives based on death.  Elizabeth Galbut  and I ask ourselves, “If I’m in a building on fire or a plane that’s crashing, do I have regrets before I die?” Our answers have been no. And while we’re alive, everything is figure-outable.

They aren't paying your bills. Nor do they care about you! There will be a point in your life where it doesn't matter. What they say won't hurt. What they think doesn't matter. We're not here to be popular. We're here to lead purposeful lives. To provide value. And sometimes there will be different opinions. That's okay. What you say is valid. What they say is valid too. What you say, what they say are: Different experiences.  Different points of views. Much of the time, the hate is a reflection of their own internal struggles. Be stoic. Don't take it personally. Otherwise, you carry that energy and it will spiral you into a cycle of self-hate. I've been through that cycle. I learnt to build a thicker amour.  I'm strengthened in my value of sharing knowledge.

Episodes include interviews with LinkedIn's product leads, as well as in-depth coverage of targeting strategies, how to get the best pricing on LinkedIn, as well as some of the basics. On whatever podcast player you use, you should be able to search for LinkedIn Ads Show, but if not, here's a link with most popular services:  https://linktr.ee/wilcoxaj As a personal favor to me, I'd love it if you listened to an episode, and give me the feedback that my closest friends don't dare. :) And if you're a  #LinkedInAds  pro, or want to be, I'd love it if you subscribed.  A HUGE thanks to my mentors in this endeavor  Spencer Shaw  &  Michael (Mike) Stelzner , and several more (you know who you are) that without their guidance, this definitely wouldn't have happened.
